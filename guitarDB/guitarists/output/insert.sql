Stevie taught himself to play the blues by the time he\'d reached high school, testing his stage skills at a Dallas club any chance he could.Well into his junior year, Vaughan had already played with several garage bands. Stevie eventually dropped out of school, moved to Austin and concentrated on making a living as a musician. In 1975, Vaughan and a few others formed Triple Threat. After some reshuffling, the group was renamed Double Trouble, inspired by an Otis Rush song. With Stevie on lead vocals, the group developed a strong fan base throughout Texas. This success led them to the Montreux Jazz Festival and their performance caught the attention of David Bowie and Jackson Browne. Bowie ended up asking Stevie to play on his forthcoming album, “Let’s Dance”, which, with Stevie’s lead guitar on six of the eight songs, became Bowie’s best selling record to date. Jackson Browne offered the group free recording time at his Downtown Studio in Los Angeles. Shortly afterward, producer John Hammond landed Steveie and Double Trouble a record contract with Epic, and the band recorded its debut album in two days over the Thanksgiving weekend at Downtown Studios…Texas Flood. A wide variety of guitars came in and out of Stevie’s possession through the years, however his 1965 Composite Fender Stratocaster, nicknamed \'Lenny\', was mostly predominate. In the Spring of 1990, Stevie played a show with Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Robert Cray. After the concert, Stevie Ray boarded a helicopter bound for Chicago.

At the age of 14 Harrison bought his first guitar and a year later joined what was initially known as the Quarry Men, which included John Lennon and Paul McCartney, as lead guitarist. When they changed their name to the Beatles in 1960, he was only 17. Harrison’s influences came from Carl Perkins and British skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan. His retooled rockabilly licks were key to the Beatles’ early sound, while his sharp, innovative lead guitar was essential to later recordings. From his raw, early rock-and-roll influences he created a wide-ranging and poetic style. In the late sixties, he helped introduce the slide guitar to prominence; he also popularized the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and its ultra-distinctive sound on 1964\'s A Hard Day\'s Night. Harrison introduced the Byrds to the Rickenbacker; they, in turn, led him to what would become a calling card: the sitar. All members of the Beatles for the most part interchanged music recording gear, which includes a number of Gibsons, Fenders, and Rickenbackers. One of the most famous guitars of George’s was his Maton Mastersound guitar, which sold at an auction for $485,00.

You may recognize him most sporting his infamous “school-boy” uniform in almost every single performance while “duckwalking” across the stage with his late ’60s Gibson SG (which he still owns over 40 years later). Young dropped out of school before his 15th birthday, where he took a job working as a typesetter at a men’s magazine. Incidentally, this position had Young put in a couple of years doing sewing machine maintenance for a company that manufactured bras. This may very well have been the influence for AC/DC’s eccentric stage presence as they inflated massive blow up dolls to overlook the stage. Best known for his solos, Young was once quoted during an interview for Guitar Player magazine as saying “There’s no great thing in being a soloist. I think the hardest thing is to play together with a lot of people, and do that right. I mean, when four guys hit one note all at once – very few people can do that.” Along with his original SG, Young has also been known to play 1970s SG, his signature SG, as well as a Gibson ES-335.

Hammett’s “Frankenstein” approach to gear started with a 1978 Fender Stratocaster where he began to take certain parts of his favorite guitars to build the perfect axe, eventually landing on a 1974 Flying V (which influenced the creation of his signature Gibson Flying V). Before Hammett was (informally) invited to join Metallica, he started off his metal career in his band Exodus. Right around when Dave Mustaine was getting fired from Metallica, Hammett was asked out to New York City to “audition”. This of course turned into a permanent affair as Hammett took on the “Kill ‘Em All” tour, taking lessons from Joe Satriani, and creating his own jazz, blues and classical influenced guitar style.

Iommi’s musical career was nearly derailed prematurely as he suffered an accident at a sheet metal factory, when a machine sliced off the tips of the fingers on his right hand. Shortly thereafter a friend turned Iommi onto guitarist Django Reinhardt (who lost the use of two fingers), inspiring Tony to give the six-string another go, using soft plastic tips attached to the ends of his fingers. In Iommi’s early days he used a Gibson SG and Les Paul guitars, a Jaydee Custom SG, a Fender Telecaster, a Steinberger Transtrem guitar, a Gibson J50 acoustic and a Fender nylon strung classical guitar. Amplification was by Laney GH100TI amplifiers, a Laney VC30 amplifier, a Marshall 2554 amplifier and Laney speakers. Guitar effects were provided by a Peavey TubeFex unit. Most recently he used a combination of his new signature Laney TI100, an old Laney Klipp and a Laney Supergroup. Iommi\'s deep and heavy sound was partially born out of necessity.

This inevitably led to a less traditional style of music playing by not predominantly using any particular guitar playing technique. Instead, Jones would combine techniques such as alternately utilizing power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and off-beat rhythm patterns creating a chaotic minimalistic style of music. Jones brought this style of playing to Tool, creating a reputation of using visual arts with a very long, complex, and psychedelic performance. At the core of Jones’ sound is his Gibson Les Paul Silverburst Custom with Seymour Duncan humbuckers. Live and in the studio, Jones uses either a 1976 Marshall Super Bass or a Diezel VH-4 “blueface.” On the latter, he never switches out of the ultra-high-output third channel. Jones drives all his amps hard to achieve his responsive tone. For effects he employs a vintage Moog Taurus bass pedal system.
