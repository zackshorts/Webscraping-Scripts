Entirely self-taught and inspired by such guitarists as B. B. King, Buddy Holly, and Muddy Waters, Jimi performed in multiple bands across the United States before forming the Jimi Hendrix Experience and releasing Are You Experienced, one of the most popular rock albums of all time. His fame was punctuated with his rendition of the Star Spangled Banner in 1969, before his death in 1970.\n\nJimi also pioneered and popularized many new techniques with the guitar, including use of amplifier feedback, wah-wah pedals, and playing chords with one’s thumb instead of the standard barre chord method. Jimi’s guitar of choice was the Fender Stratocaster, which he flipped and restrung to be played left-handed, giving it unusual sound characteristics the Stratocaster was not intended to have. He also played a Gibson Flying V, and used a King Vox-Wah pedal, a Uni-Vibe Phaser, and a Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face, with Marshall amplifiers.\n        "

Fender later released a model of the Mustang named after Kurt after his death. Kurt also played a Sunburst Stratocaster, also modified to be played left-handed.

Hetfield grew up in a heavily Christian Science influenced household, which ended up playing a large part in his youth and in turn, the lyrics of many of Metallica’s songs. At the age of 9, Hetfield took piano lessons before taking on brother David's drums and finally picking up a guitar in his pre-teens. Hetfield hooked up with fellow band member and drummer Lars Ulrich, who had placed an ad in the newspaper looking for someone to jam with, and in October 1981, Metallica was born. In 1986 they toured to promote their third album, Master of Puppets. The gear list of a rock star is most definitely an extensive one, and Hetfield is no different sporting several ESPs, Trussarts, Gibsons, and a beautiful butterscotch Fender Telecaster B-Bender. Mesa Boogies dominate Hetfield’s amp gear and a Shure Super 55 stage microphone help him belt out his classic hits. \n        "

      "description": "Stevie Ray Vaughn was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas. The first glimpse of Vaughan as a musician started off with his older brother Jimmie's guitar playing. Stevie picked up his first guitar at the age of 10, a plastic Sears toy. Stevie taught himself to play the blues by the time he'd reached high school, testing his stage skills at a Dallas club any chance he could.\nWell into his junior year, Vaughan had already played with several garage bands. Stevie eventually dropped out of school, moved to Austin and concentrated on making a living as a musician. In 1975, Vaughan and a few others formed Triple Threat. After some reshuffling, the group was renamed Double Trouble, inspired by an Otis Rush song. With Stevie on lead vocals, the group developed a strong fan base throughout Texas. This success led them to the Montreux Jazz Festival and their performance caught the attention of David Bowie and Jackson Browne. Bowie ended up asking Stevie to play on his forthcoming album, “Let’s Dance”, which, with Stevie’s lead guitar on six of the eight songs, became Bowie’s best selling record to date. Jackson Browne offered the group free recording time at his Downtown Studio in Los Angeles. Shortly afterward, producer John Hammond landed Steveie and Double Trouble a record contract with Epic, and the band recorded its debut album in two days over the Thanksgiving weekend at Downtown Studios…Texas Flood. A wide variety of guitars came in and out of Stevie’s possession through the years, however his 1965 Composite Fender Stratocaster, nicknamed 'Lenny', was mostly predominate. In the Spring of 1990, Stevie played a show with Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Jimmie Vaughan, and Robert Cray. After the concert, Stevie Ray boarded a helicopter bound for Chicago. Minutes after its 12:50 a.m. takeoff, the helicopter crashed, killing Vaughan and the other four passengers.\n        "

      "description": "Born in Liverpool in 1943, George Harrison’s first whiff of the music scene started out from listening to Elvis Presley’s “Heartbreak Hotel”. At the age of 14 Harrison bought his first guitar and a year later joined what was initially known as the Quarry Men, which included John Lennon and Paul McCartney, as lead guitarist. When they changed their name to the Beatles in 1960, he was only 17. Harrison’s influences came from Carl Perkins and British skiffle legend Lonnie Donegan. His retooled rockabilly licks were key to the Beatles’ early sound, while his sharp, innovative lead guitar was essential to later recordings. From his raw, early rock-and-roll influences he created a wide-ranging and poetic style. In the late sixties, he helped introduce the slide guitar to prominence; he also popularized the 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and its ultra-distinctive sound on 1964's A Hard Day's Night. Harrison introduced the Byrds to the Rickenbacker; they, in turn, led him to what would become a calling card: the sitar. All members of the Beatles for the most part interchanged music recording gear, which includes a number of Gibsons, Fenders, and Rickenbackers. One of the most famous guitars of George’s was his Maton Mastersound guitar, which sold at an auction for $485,00. George Harrison died of lung cancer on November 29, 2001, at a friend’s home in Los Angeles. He was 58 years old.\n        "

      "description": "Angus McKinnon Young is the Scottish-born Australian co-founder, lead guitarist, and songwriter of the Australian hard rock band, AC/DC. Alongside his brother Malcolm, Young released their first single “Can I Sit Next To You”, and their debut album “High Voltage”. You may recognize him most sporting his infamous “school-boy” uniform in almost every single performance while “duckwalking” across the stage with his late ’60s Gibson SG (which he still owns over 40 years later). Young dropped out of school before his 15th birthday, where he took a job working as a typesetter at a men’s magazine. Incidentally, this position had Young put in a couple of years doing sewing machine maintenance for a company that manufactured bras. This may very well have been the influence for AC/DC’s eccentric stage presence as they inflated massive blow up dolls to overlook the stage. Best known for his solos, Young was once quoted during an interview for Guitar Player magazine as saying “There’s no great thing in being a soloist. I think the hardest thing is to play together with a lot of people, and do that right. I mean, when four guys hit one note all at once – very few people can do that.” Along with his original SG, Young has also been known to play 1970s SG, his signature SG, as well as a Gibson ES-335. For amps, Young uses Marshalls with Celestion speakers.\n        "

      "description": "Born in San Francisco, and raised in the East Bay town of El Sobrante, Kirk Hammett gained an interest in music from his brother Rick's extensive record collection. Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and UFO all led to Hammett properly picking up the guitar when he was 15, a Montgomery Ward catalog special accompanied by a shoe box with 4 inch speaker for an amp. Hammett’s “Frankenstein” approach to gear started with a 1978 Fender Stratocaster where he began to take certain parts of his favorite guitars to build the perfect axe, eventually landing on a 1974 Flying V (which influenced the creation of his signature Gibson Flying V). \n\nBefore Hammett was (informally) invited to join Metallica, he started off his metal career in his band Exodus. Right around when Dave Mustaine was getting fired from Metallica, Hammett was asked out to New York City to “audition”. This of course turned into a permanent affair as Hammett took on the “Kill ‘Em All” tour, taking lessons from Joe Satriani, and creating his own jazz, blues and classical influenced guitar style. The rest of Hammett’s inspirations can be seen in his Mesa Boogie and Randall amplifiers, along with his array of distortion pedals from Ibanez, Line 6, and DigiTech.\n        "

      "description": "John Winston Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, during a German air raid in World War II. After his parents separated, Lennon was sent to live with his Aunt Mimi who ended up buying his first guitar. Later on, with the inspiration from Elvis Presley, 16-year old John Lennon formed his first band called the Quarry Men. In the summer of 1956 he met Paul McCartney, and they began writing songs together and forming groups, one of which would turn out to be the Beatles. As half of the official songwriting team, Lennon himself penned some of the Beatles' most well-known songs over the next decade including \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Help!\" \"Nowhere Man,\" \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),\" \"Ticket To Ride,\" \"All You Need Is Love,\" \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" \"Across the Universe,\" \"Revolution,\" and \"Come Together.\" Lennon spent much of his career frequently relying on an Epiphone Casino with its finish stripped to the wood (which inspired the creation of the By John Lennon Casino). But he also notably played a Gibson Les Paul Junior with a Charlie Christian pickup and an Epiphone J-160E acoustic. Fender, Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and Guild are also just a few examples of the many guitars Lennon used. Most of the time Lennon was using a Vox AC30 Guitar Combo Amp or Conqueror Amplifier with some limited effects with his Maestro Fuzz-Tone or Vox Tonebender. In 1980, Lennon released the album Double Fantasy, featuring the hit single \"(Just Like) Starting Over.\" Just a few weeks after the album's release, Lennon was shot several times by a deranged fan in front of his apartment complex in New York City. Lennon died at New York City's Roosevelt Hospital on December 8, 1980, at the age of 40.\n        "

His earliest influences were Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, thanks in large part to his Father who was an avid music fan. When he was 12 years old, he had his own band called Smokin' Joe Bonamassa. Soon after the formation of his band, he was asked to open for B.B. King. After that, Bonamassa formed the band Bloodline, which is where his guitar chops really begun to spark some interest. From there Bonamassa made his solo debut in 2000 with his album A New Day Yesterday, then 2002's So It's Like That, then Blues Deluxe a collection of three original tunes and nine classic blues numbers from artists like John Lee Hooker, Albert Collins, Robert Johnson, and Elmore James, and so many...many others! Bonamassa’s favorite guitar is a ’59 Les Paul Sunburst, a “Holy Grail” that he actually takes on the road with him. On this guitar (along with the rest of his guitars) who uses heavy gauge strings as a “preventative measure”. He was quoted in an article with Premier Guitar as saying “I have a tendency to put in a million notes and show off to the world, and that’s not usually my best solo. So, the .011s keep me from going there all the time.” Bonamassa's pedalboard starts with his signature Dunlop Cry Baby wah into a Fulltone Supa-Trem into a Dave Friedman splitter. Another signature of his is the Dunlop Bonamassa Fuzz Face. Amp wise, he’s been known to use one 50-watt vintage Marshall with a Diaz Vibramaster and a Marshall JCM 2000 Dual Super Lead.\n        "
